<h2 id="toc_1">Part I - 1.1 Database structure</h2>

<p>Here is the Entity-Relationship diagram of the database. The attributes are not shown because there are too many for some of the tables. Instead, they can be find in the following figure illustrating the relational model.
<div style="text-align:center">
<img src="../../ER_Diagram.png" width="800">
</div></p>

<p>Here is the relational model of the database. Primary keys are marked as orange and foreign keys are marked as blue. Also the arrows indicate the reference relations between the tables.</p>

<div style="text-align:center">
<img src="../../RelationalModel.png" width="800">
</div>

<h2 id="toc_2">Part I - 1.2 Data cleaning</h2>

<p>First some sanity checks and consistency checks were performed on the yelp database. The data in the database should follow rules and should be consistent with each other. After studying the relationship models in of it, we perfomed the following checks and cleaning:
- Logical time checks: review or becoming an elite member can not occur before yelp was founded or from the future. 
- Logic consistency checks: a user can not leave a review before creating the account, a user can not become an elite member before becoming a yelp user, people should not check in at a business outside open hours, and the reviews written by each user should be in consistent with that in the user table.</p>

<p>We first got the queries ready, then came up with the following indices to accelerate the running of queries. As we are going to time the execution commands, they are added before further discussion, as shown in 1.2.1. After that in 1.2.2, we will introduce the checking queries and the measures taken to deal with the inconsistency and broken data. </p>

<h3 id="toc_3">1.2.1 Indexing the sanity check queries</h3>

<p>To allow for faster queries additional indices were added to some tables in the database. This includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>adding one to the year column in the table elite<em>years to speed up query</em>6

<ul>
<li>create index idx<em>year on elite</em>years(year)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>adding one to the yelping_since column in the user table

<ul>
<li>create index idx<em>yelping</em>since on user(yelping_since)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>creating new columns in the hours table to split the hours column into date, opening<em>time and closing</em>time and creating an index for each of these

<ul>
<li>create index idx<em>day</em>of<em>week on hours(day</em>of_week)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>creating new columns in the checkin table to split the date column into date<em>of</em>week and time and creating an index for each of these

<ul>
<li>create index idx<em>day</em>of<em>week on hours(day</em>of_week)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>creating new columns in the review table to split the date column into year, month, day columns and scrapping the time because its always 00:00:00

<ul>
<li>select count(*) from review where substring_index(date, &#39; &#39;, -1) != &#39;00:00:00&#39;; #returns 0</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<div><pre><code class="language-python">index_1_1 = &quot;create index idx_year on elite_years(year);&quot;
index_1_2 = &quot;create index idx_yelping_since on user(yelping_since);&quot;

executeQuery(yelp_conn, index_1_1, returnResult=False)
executeQuery(yelp_conn, index_1_2, returnResult=False)</code></pre></div>

<div><pre><code class="language-none">()</code></pre></div>

<p><code>index2</code> is too long to execute here. It uses a procedure to create a new <code>hour</code> table with openning and closing time as seperate columns, so we do not need to parse the time column to retrieve the openning and closing tome. In fact, we think it is a bad practice in the original database to put these two in the same columnn as it violates 1NF.
<code>index3</code> as shown below, creates indexes for this new table:</p>

<div><pre><code class="language-python">index_3_1 = &quot;create index idx_day_of_week on hours_new(day_of_week);&quot;
index_3_2 = &quot;create index idx_opening_time on hours_new(opening_time);&quot;
index_3_3 = &quot;create index idx_closing_time on hours_new(closing_time);&quot;
executeQuery(yelp_conn, index_3_1, returnResult=False)
executeQuery(yelp_conn, index_3_2, returnResult=False)
executeQuery(yelp_conn, index_3_3, returnResult=False)</code></pre></div>

<div><pre><code class="language-none">()</code></pre></div>

<p>Again, <code>index4</code> creates a new table based on checkin table which creates seperated columns for time digits.</p>

<p>This <code>index5</code> series, create the indexes for the new check_in table:</p>

<div><pre><code class="language-python">index_5_1 =  &quot;create index idx_day_of_week on checkin_new(day_of_week)&quot;
index_5_2 =  &quot;create index idx_opening_time on checkin_new(checkin_time)&quot;
executeQuery(yelp_conn, query_5_1)
executeQuery(yelp_conn, query_5_2)</code></pre></div>

<h3 id="toc_4">1.2.2 Sanity/consistency check and cleaning</h3>

<h4 id="toc_5">1. Check that no review is from the future or before Yelp&#39;s founding</h4>

<div><pre><code class="language-python">query_1 = &quot;SELECT id, date FROM review WHERE unix_timestamp(date) &lt;= unix_timestamp(&#39;2004-10-01&#39;)\

<p>This shows 2 accounts that were created before Yelp&#39;s founding in October 2004.</p>

<p><strong>Timing analysis:</strong> As shown in the result the query runs in about 3 seconds as shown in the output. When we delete the keys and indexes, the out put is like this:</p>

<div><pre><code class="language-python">Wall time: 15.292s</code></pre></div>

<p>Therefore the keys and indexes bring about 5 times improvement in running speed.</p>

<p>This query deletes the illegel records:</p>

<div><pre><code class="language-python">clean_1 = &quot;DELETE FROM review WHERE unix_timestamp(date) &lt;= unix_timestamp(&#39;2004-10-01&#39;)\

<p><strong>Timing analysis:</strong> It takes about 40 seconds to run the query. After we deleted all indexes and keys we ran it again by setting the time out threshold to 5 minutes, and it timed out.</p>

<p>No illegal elite users records are found in the notebook.</p>

<p><strong>Timing analysis:</strong> This query runs quite fast (within 1 second). However, somehow it timed out (&gt;5min threshold we set) when it is run on a database without keys and indexes. We think it is because this query involves joining operations.</p>

<div><pre><code class="language-python">heading_3 = (&quot;user.id&quot;, &quot;user.yelping_since&quot;, &quot;elite_year.year&quot;)

Wall time: 5min 14s
(55493,)</code></pre></div>

<p><strong>Timing analysis:</strong> This query takes about 5 mins to run. After we removed the keys and indices, the run time becomes incredibly long so we shut it down.</p>

<p>This shows that there are many check ins that occur outside of the businesses open hours which are potentially invalid checkins, but this is not a guarantee because it is possible that the business changed their hours of operation at some point after someone checked in, resulting in the discrepency. </p>

<p>This also shows the need within the database for the date column in the checkin and the hours column in the hours table to be normalized by splitting into date, opening time and closing time columns as this would save computation time having to perform substring_index computations on every row. No change is made to the database to correct this because it may sometimes happen since the business may change its open hours without updating that on yelp.</p>

<h4 id="toc_9">5. <code>User.review_count</code> cannot be less than the sum of the number of reviews by a user</h4>

<div><pre><code class="language-python">query_5 = &quot;select count(*) from user join (select count(user_id) as countedReviews, user_id from\
           review group by user_id) as a on a.user_id = user.id where a.countedReviews &gt; review_count;&quot;

print(result_5[0])</code></pre></div>

<div><pre><code class="language-none">CPU times: user 6.4 ms, sys: 4.47 ms, total: 10.9 ms
Wall time: 3min 49s
(1323,)</code></pre></div>

<p><strong>Timing analysis:</strong> As shown above it takes about 4min. After deleting all indexes and keys the run time was too long so and was interrupted.</p>

<p>This shows that the way Yelp gets the review_count number is potentially flawed since it should never count there being less reviews than the number of reviews provided for each user, unless the dataset that it was acquiring the count from was out of date. </p>

<p>This query updates the incorrect review_count:</p>

<div><pre><code class="language-python">clean_5_1 = &quot;CREATE VIEW review_counts_for_users AS\
             SELECT user_id, count(user_id) AS count\

<h4 id="toc_10">6. Cannot be Elite in an invalid year</h4>

<p>Invalid years include ones before 2004, years in the future or years they didn&#39;t post a review, tip or photo.</p>

<div><pre><code class="language-python">query_6 = &quot;select count(*) from elite_years join \
           (SELECT user_id, SUBSTRING_INDEX(date, &#39;-&#39;, 1) AS year FROM review) \

<p><strong>Timing analysis:</strong> Again this query includes joining operations, so it took very long time if the keys and indexes are removed. Overall, huge improvement can be observed when keys and indexes are applied.</p>

<p>In total there are 186900 entries in elite_years. 37 appear to be erroneous. This query deletes these incorrect elite records:</p>

<h3 id="toc_12">Methods</h3>

<p>Now that we&#39;re confident that the data is sufficiently cleaned as to not produce erroneous results from our analysis outside of those of interest, we can begin performing the actual analysis of trends in the data. The trend that was analyzed is the affect different attributes about users and their reviews have on the likelihood that their review is spam. These attributes include the type of business being reviewed, the ratings of the reviews left by users, the average<em>stars of the user, the time between account creation and  and the review</em>count of the user. In order to determine if a given query returns reviews that are spam a machine learning classifier was used that implemented a bag-of-words model and applied a naive Bayes and random forest classifier onto this model. The metric we looked at to determine the liklihood that a review is spam is the accuracy of the classifier in classifying the suspected spam reviews when mixed with reviews that are not spam.<br>
The bag-of-words model takes each spam and not spam review and looks at the words that occur most frequently in the reviews to use those as features. In this case we looked at the top 5000 most occuring adjectives and adverbs in the review to use as features. We found the adjectives and adverbs using NLTK&#39;s part of speech tagging on every review and decided to go with these parts of speech because they are the words of interest in reviews in general and provide and easy way to eliminate frequently occuring words in general that are not specific to reviews (ex. &#39;the&#39; and &#39;it&#39;).<br>
Classification was performed initially using only a naive Bayes classifier that is built into the NLTK library which uses Bayes theorem to determine the probability that a review is spam given the probability that each feature (word) in the review is spam. If this probability is over 50% then that review is classified as spam. Later on other classificiation algorithms were tried to see if a better classification accuracy could be achieved such as scikit-learn&#39;s random forest classifier and gaussian naive Bayes, however in general these algorithms performed worse than NLTK&#39;s naive Bayes classifier so it was the only one used to save computation time.<br>
Accuracy of the spam prediction was determined by splitting the shuffled spam and ham reviews in half, with one half becoming the training set to train the classifier on, and the other half becoming the testing set which the spam classifier is tested on to determine its accuracy.
The metrics analyzed were:</p>

<ul>
<li>Categories - Restaurants, Health &amp; Medical, Shopping, Beauty &amp; Spas, Home Services, Nightlife and Automotive were lo</li>
<li>Age - Time between account creation and first review for potential bot accounts with only a single review, looked between 0 and 6 days one day at a time</li>
<li>number of reviews - The minimum numbers of reviews that an accounts needs to leave to not be classified as spam</li>
<li>number of results - the number of rows from each query that were analyzed, this was left fixed at 1000 for speed</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="toc_13">Results</h3>

<div style="text-align:center">
<img src="../../pythonAnalysis/figures/1_review_stars.png" width="800">
</div>

<p>It was found that the longer someone waited to leave their first review from account creation, the less likely it was to be spam. This was expected as any bot account that is created to simply boost up the score of a restaurant would leave a review immediately after creation, as opposed to a real user that may make their account and then not leave a review on a business until they go to one a while later. The downside of this metric is that there are also many real used that create account while at a business and leave an overly positive or negative review because its fresh in their memory.
<div style="text-align:center">
<img src="../../pythonAnalysis/figures/categories.png" width="800"><br>
</div>
Next, it was found that amoungst the different categories of businesses that Automotive businesses were the least likely to have spam reviews, while shopping locations were the most. Analyzing this further reveals that on average the automotive customers were more likely to have accounts with only one review for the automotive business, suggesting automotive people are less likely to be active users versus shopping locations which have legitimate users that are more active Yelp users so the ones with only one review are more likely to be spam.<br>
<div style="text-align:center">
<img src="../../pythonAnalysis/figures/avg_stars.png" width="800">
</div>
It was also found that the average<em>stars of the users&#39; account influences the likelihood that their reviews are spam in that if a users&#39; average</em>stars is 5 or 1 versus if their average_stars is some other value showing that they&#39;ve given other reviews besides just the top score or the lowest. This metric would miss spam users that use their account for spamming both high and low, instead of only doing one or the other.</p>

<h3 id="toc_14">Future Work</h3>

<p>While classifiers for spam emails are quite well established, spam classifiers for reviews are more challenging because they lack many of the features that are indicative of spam such as including links or using language that suggests that the person is trying to sell something. However, this is an active area of research and there are other more complex features that have been identified that have been shown to indicate a review is spam such as: <a href="reference:%20http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P14-1147">(reference)</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Using a separate gold standard dataset of honest and deceptive reviews to train with instead of using approximations from the dataset</li>
<li>Look for spacial details in a review to indicate honesty (ex. terms such as “bathroom”) while deceptive reviews will talk about general concepts such as why or with whom they went to the hotel</li>
<li>Using Bayesian learning to analyze multiple of these metrics together to draw a more definitive conclusion</li>
<li>Checking for if there are many grammatical and spelling mistakes </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_15">Part II. 2.1 User control</h2>

<h3 id="toc_16">2.1.1 Description of the problem</h3>

<p>In real applications, the Yelp database is expected to be visited by
different groups of people, including customers (users), data analyst
(special users), and developers. In this project, this is further
divided into five categories:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A casual user who uses the application to browse search results.
These users do not need to have an account; hence, they cannot
submit reviews.</p></li>
<li><p>Critiques that use the application to browse results just like the
casual user, but they also leave reviews for places they visit. A
logged in user should only be provided enough privileges to write
the review.</p></li>
<li><p>Business analysts can use the application to produce sales reports
and may want to do special data mining and analysis. They cannot
perform IUD (Insert/Update/Delete) operations on the database but
should have access to creating extra views on the database schema.</p></li>
<li><p>Developers working with this database are able to create new tables
and perform data cleaning and indexing. They are allowed to perform
IUD operations on the database.</p></li>
<li><p>The database admin who has full access over the database.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The principle of granting privilege is to guarantee that each group of
people have sufficient permission in order to protect the database.
First, the list of all privileges in MySQL 5.7 are listed in the Table below, from which we can choose levels for each user
group.</p>

<h3 id="toc_17">2.1.2 Group 1</h3>

<p>For the first group of users, they only browse information about the
business, including their opening hours, stars, reviews, without signing
in so they do not need to write information into the database. In some
cases, if the app allows some specific types of anonymous
communications, such as marking a review as “cool&quot; or “useful” by a
visitor, then the permission should be extended to allow for
modification of the count of these tags. However, in this project we
assume that the user are not allowed to perform any operations except
exploring. Hereby we only grant <code>SELECT</code> privilege to the first group of
user, which we call <code>user1</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code class="language-none">DROP USER IF EXISTS &#39;user1&#39;@&#39;%&#39;;
CREATE USER user1;
GRANT SELECT ON yelp_db.* TO &#39;user1&#39;@&#39;%&#39;;</code></pre></div>

<h3 id="toc_18">2.1.3 Group 2</h3>

<p>For the second type of user, they are different from casual users in
that they may leave reviews or tips on a business. They are logged-in
users, so they can interact with other reviews or tips. Therefore, they
are granted global <code>SELECT</code> privilege, <code>INSERT</code> on the review and tip
table, <code>UPDATE</code> on certain columns in the business table, and table-wise
<code>UPDATE</code> on user table. The SQL query is shown as follows, similarly we
call this <code>user2</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code class="language-none">DROP USER IF EXISTS &#39;user2&#39;@&#39;%&#39;;
CREATE USER user2;
GRANT SELECT ON yelp_db.* TO &#39;user2&#39;@&#39;%&#39;;
GRANT INSERT ON yelp_db.review TO &#39;user2&#39;@&#39;%&#39;;
GRANT INSERT ON yelp_db.tip TO &#39;user2&#39;@&#39;%&#39;;
GRANT UPDATE (stars) ON yelp_db.business TO &#39;user2&#39;@&#39;%&#39;;
GRANT UPDATE (review_count) ON yelp_db.business TO &#39;user2&#39;@&#39;%&#39;;
GRANT UPDATE ON yelp_db.user TO &#39;user2&#39;@&#39;%&#39;;</code></pre></div>

<h3 id="toc_19">2.1.4 Group 3</h3>

<p>Business analysts are special casual users. Here we assume they are not
logged in so they are not expected to change any contents in the
database. Therefore, we only add some view-related privileges to this
group of users besides those granted to group 1:</p>

<div><pre><code class="language-none">DROP USER IF EXISTS &#39;user3&#39;@&#39;%&#39;;
CREATE USER user3;
GRANT SELECT, CREATE VIEW, SHOW VIEW ON yelp_db.* TO &#39;user3&#39;@&#39;%&#39;;</code></pre></div>

<h3 id="toc_20">2.1.5 Group 4</h3>

<p>Group 4 corresponds to normal developers. These people are in charge of
the visiting, development and maintenance of database. Therefore we
grant them full IUD privileges on the whole database. Also, in case they
need to perform automated operations, query optimization or concurrency
control, we also grant them with view, routine(function, procedure),
index and lock permissions. The SQL queries are as follows:</p>

<div><pre><code class="language-none">DROP USER IF EXISTS &#39;user4&#39;@&#39;%&#39;;
CREATE USER user4;
GRANT ALTER ROUTINE, CREATE ROUTINE, EXECUTE, # routine related
CREATE VIEW, SHOW VIEW, # view related
CREATE, ALTER, INDEX, REFERENCES, # tables, indexes and keys
DELETE, DROP, INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE # basic operations including IUD
ON yelp_db.* TO &#39;user4&#39;@&#39;%&#39;;</code></pre></div>

<h3 id="toc_21">2.1.6 Group 5</h3>

<p>Group 5 is the database administrator, so its privilege is all but
<code>GRANT</code> and <code>PROXY</code> options, which should only be done using the root
user. In practical use only these two operations should be done using
root user in order to prevent abuse or unexpected threats to the
database. The SQL queries are as follows:</p>

<div><pre><code class="language-none">DROP USER IF EXISTS &#39;user5&#39;@&#39;%&#39;;
CREATE USER user5;
GRANT ALL ON yelp_db.* TO &#39;user5&#39;@&#39;%&#39;;</code></pre></div>
